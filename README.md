- The player starts in the midle of the screen.

- The apples appear in random places of the screan after eating the previous one.

- The player can move left, right, up, or down with the arrow buttons or by pressing the WASD keys to eat the apples.

- The game ends either when the player eats their tail or when the snake goes of the screen.
