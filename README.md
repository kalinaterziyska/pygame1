The goal of the game is to eat the apples which gives you point and get as many points as you can:

- In the begining there is a menu from whic the player has to choose to play either 'Option 1. Play with obsticles' or 'Opion 2. play without obsicles' 

- The player starts in the midle of the screen.

- The player can move left, right, up, or down with the arrow buttons or by pressing the WASD keys to eat the apples and every eaten apple goves you a point.

- The apples appear in random places of the screen after eating the previous one.

- The game ends either when the player eats their tail or when the snake goes of the screen or for option 1 on the menu when the player hits an obsticle.

Here are some things that wonâ€™t be covered in this tutorial:

- No multiple lives

- No advancing levels
